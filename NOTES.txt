The speakers with INVALID FINGERPRINTS are: 231, 232, 250, 253, 257, 266, 273, 285

The 7 speakers with the MOST DATA are: 236, 239, 250, 259, 264, 274, 283

TODO:
- create transformer-based speaker verification system
- compare transformer-based SV runtime against LSTM-based SV runtime
- assuming it's a lot faster, train it on LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb, and as much other data as you can get
- preprocess the data dump somehow?
- train the adapted version of FastSpeech on the massive data dump, gathering fingerprints ad hoc
